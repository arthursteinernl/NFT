    <h1>Collect your Digital Artwork</h1>
    

    <p>In reaction to the global NFT hype, Studio Continuo presents the limited edition NFT, "Don't Turn Around" by Polina Kanis. As an experiment we have created a free limited edition of 25 digital artworks.</p><p>The works can only be collected if you physically visit the exhibition and ask for the secret password.</p><p> Through her work, Polina Kanis reflects on human action and agency in an age of rapid automation, financialization and algorithmic governance. How can we emancipate ourselves from the central financial infrastructures that rule our day-to-day life?</p> <p>Once you have obtained your digital collectible, you are able to store it in your MetaMask Wallet or show it in a gallery in a decentralized virtual world such as <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com">Cryptovoxels</a> and <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a>.</p>
