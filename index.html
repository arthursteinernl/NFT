    <h1>Collect your Digital Artwork</h1>
    <p>The boundaries between virtual and physical spaces are dissolving. We can stroll through virtual museums and collect digital art in the form of nun-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>

    <p>As part of the exhibition ‘Don’t Turn Around’ we have created a free limited edition of 25 digital artworks. The works can only be collected if you physically visit the exhibition. Once you have obtained your digital collectible, you are able to store it in your digital art collection or show it in a gallery in a decentralized virtual world such as <a href="http://cryptovoxels.com">Cryptovoxels</a> and <a href="https://decentraland.org">Decentraland</a>.</p>
